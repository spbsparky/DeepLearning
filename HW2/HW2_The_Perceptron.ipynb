    "#### TODO: Add your answer here (code and text)\n",
    "Yes, it is necessary to train with all of the training data in order to get the highest possible accuracy with the test dataset, using all of the data is the only way to ensure that the perceptron has access to the most valid data points which wil naturally increase the accuracy of the model. There is not a second run in any of the models that were trained that results in a lower accuracy than the first dataset, in fact in the first two learning rates, the second dataset perfectly ties with the first dataset, whereas in the third learning rate, the second run actually shows a 5% increase in the overall accuracy from 64.0 to 69.0. No, given the size of this training set the maximum accuracy that can be reached is 80.0, even if one were to increase the epochs and the learning rate(look at below results with 200,400 for epochs and 0.1,0.2,0.4 for learning rates). Keeping all other parameters fixed, it is not always worth it to train more epochs as there are certain situations(such as 50 epochs vs 20 epochs at a learning rate of 0.1) where the accuracy drops - in this case, the accuracy drops by 4%, from 68.0 to 64.0.\n",
